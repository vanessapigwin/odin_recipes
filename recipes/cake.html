    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This strawberry shortcake is the classic, sweet biscuit-style shortcake — 
        not the pound cake variety. The cake is sliced in half and layered 
        with juicy strawberries and whipped cream for a delicious summertime treat.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pints fresh strawberries</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅓ cup shortening</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 cups whipped heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the strawberries and toss them with 1/2 cup of white sugar. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease and flour one 
            8-inch round cake pan.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder, 2 tablespoons white sugar 
            and the salt. With a pastry blender cut in the shortening until the mixture 
            resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center and add the beaten egg 
            and milk.</li>
        <li>Stir mixture until just combined.</li>
        <li>Spread the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. 
            Let cool partially in pan on wire rack.
        </li>
        <li>Slice partially cooled cake in half, making two layers.</li>
        <li>Place half of the strawberries on one layer and top with the other layer. 
            Top with remaining strawberries and cover with the whipped cream.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
